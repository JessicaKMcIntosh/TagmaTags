This plugin uses the Tool Tip / Balloon functionality of Vim to display Tool
Tips for code. Currently only Awl, Tcl and Vim are supported.

==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION					*TagmaTags-description*

This plugin uses the Vim |tags| functionality to enable looking up
documentation for a programming language.

A set of documentation for the programming language is stored in a
subdirectory. The tags file in that directory links programming language terms
to the documentation. This allows the use of Vims tag functions to lookup
terms in the documentation. For example when editing a Perl file placing the
cursor over the function "print" will load the file perlfunc.man and jump to
the definition for "print",

This works via a file type plugin. When editing a supported file type the tags
file for the language is added to the end of the buffer local tags list.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					*TagmaTags-installation*

Copy the files to your ~/.vim or ~/vimfiles directory.
If using a package manager like pathogen place the whole directory in the
bundle directory.
 
==============================================================================
USAGE						*TagmaTags-usage*

The normal Vim tag navigation commands and key mappings are used to jump to
the documentation. See the help section |tags| for specific details.

Handy key mappings: ~

CTRL-]			Jump to the tag under the cursor. The documentation
			will be opened in the current window.

{Visual}CTRL-]		Similar to CTRL-] but jumps to the tag visually
			selected.

CTRL-W }		Jumps to the tag under the cursor. The documentation
			will be opened in the preview window.

==============================================================================
PERL SUPPORT					*TagmaTags-perl*

The perl documentation is located in the perldocs/ subdirectoy in .man files.
Documentation for perlfunc, perlvar, Pragmas and many standarf functional
modules is present.

The Perl documentation can be regenerated from your local Perl installation
using the program gen_perldocs.pl located in the perldocs/ subdirectory. This
program uses the perldoc program to generate the .man files and the tags file.
