This is the start of the project, more a proof of concept.

I have not yet created documentation.

Copy these files to your .vim or vimfiles directory.

When editing Perl files the tags file in the perl subdirectory will be added to
the tags file setting for the buffer.

Using Vim tag functions such as Ctrl-] or Ctrl-W } (calls :ptjump, a very handy
feature) will navigate to the location in the appropriate documentation file
for a Perl function. 

For the moment only a few Perl manuals have been setup. I will work on adding
more and refining.
